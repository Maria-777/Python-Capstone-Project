The dataset is in .csv format. \n\n*The attributes that have the most importance for us in order to predict the severity of the car accidents are*:\n\n1. weather\n2. road conditions\n3. light conditions\n4. inattention of the driver\n5. driver being under influence\n\n*The severity of the accident is shown on the dataset by the following attributes*:\n\n1. severity of collision\n2. number of vehicles and people involved in the accident\n3. seriousness of injures and/or fatalities"
